## Nomenclature
While following this guide, you will run commands on both the RB5 and the computer you are using to flash it. To disambiguate these two, we will use the following terminology:
* When you see the term *device* or *target*, it refers to the RB5.
* When you see the term *host*, *host system*, or *host computer*, it refers to the computer being used to flash the RB5.

## Components
In order to bring up the RB5 platform for the first time, you will need the following:
* physical access to the RB5 device
* a host computer with a connection to the internet
* a USB-C cable
* a Thundercomm account

This procedure is expected to take around an hour if starting from scratch. It may take longer if your network connection is slow.

## Host System Configuration
A host system running Ubuntu 24.04 was used to verify these steps. It is likely that older versions of Ubuntu would work too, but this hasn't been tested.

## Thundercomm Account
Thundercomm produces the RB5 physical hardware and the software build. You will need to download some files from them which requires an account.

You can create an account [here](https://www.thundercomm.com/register/).
